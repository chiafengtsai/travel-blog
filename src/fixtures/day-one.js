      "<strong>New Zealand</strong>, since I've relocated to Melbourne, this place has been mentioned now and then, people around me keep telling me how beautiful it is, what kind of landscape you would get to see there, and it's no doubt the most beautiful place they ever visited in their life. The question for me is never 'do I wanna go?', I know it's something definitely will happen, just matter of time. so the question actually is, 'when I am gonna make this trip happen?'. <br/>Finally Arisa and I make the decision to go New Zealnad before she goes back to Japan. A 8 days trip which turned out to be the most wonderful trip for both of us, we wish we could stay there longer, but I guess it's never long enough when you have such a beautiful trip like this."
